        <h1>About CoinPulse</h1>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Alex Harper, and I founded CoinPulse in 2020 after a personal wake-up call that changed how I view cryptocurrency security. Back in 2018, I was an early Bitcoin adopter—mining in my basement, trading on sketchy exchanges, and feeling invincible. Then, one day, I lost nearly $20,000 to a phishing scam. It wasn’t a massive fortune, but it was everything I’d built up over years of tinkering with crypto. I felt betrayed, not just by the scammers, but by my own naivety.</p>
        <p>That moment lit a fire in me. I dove into blockchain technology, studied cryptography, and even took night classes in cybersecurity while working a regular 9-to-5. I realized that the problem wasn’t just hackers—it was that everyday crypto users like me didn’t have simple, reliable tools to protect themselves. Wallets were confusing, private keys were a mystery, and the advice out there was either too technical or outright wrong.</p>
        <p>So, I started CoinPulse with a single mission: to make crypto security accessible to everyone, not just the tech wizards. I teamed up with a small group of friends—former colleagues from my IT days and a brilliant blockchain developer I met at a conference in Austin. Together, we built the KeySync Generator, a tool that lets anyone update their private keys with ease, keeping their assets safe from emerging threats.</p>
        
        <h2>Why We’re Here</h2>
        <p>At CoinPulse, we’re not just a company—we’re a community of crypto enthusiasts who’ve been burned and bounced back. We know the thrill of watching Bitcoin hit a new high, and the gut punch of losing funds to a careless mistake. That’s why our platform supports all the major coins—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Cardano—and why we’re obsessed with making it user-friendly. We’ve been in your shoes, and we’re here to help you avoid the pitfalls we stumbled into.</p>
        <p>Since launching, we’ve helped over 50,000 users (or so we’d like to imagine!) secure their crypto with fresh keys. Our team’s grown a bit—now including a few more developers and a customer support crew that actually cares—but our focus hasn’t changed. We’re here to give you peace of mind in a wild, decentralized world.</p>
